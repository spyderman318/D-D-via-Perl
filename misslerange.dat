* Range is given in tens of yards.  Each range category (S=Short, M=Medium, L=Long) includes attacks from distances equal to or less than the given range.
** "rof" is the rate of fire - How many shots that weapon can fire off in one round.  This is independent of the number of melee attacks a character can make in a round.
The Modifiers for range are -2 for medium range, and -5 for long range.  Arquebus (if allowed) double all range modifiers.
