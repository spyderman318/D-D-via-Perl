#  Random Book Generator for 14,000-Volume Library
#
#   
#
#               Any fool could have just systematized fantasy fiction and had a fun enough product—indeed, that’s all most alternative RPG systems amount to. But Gygax et al. created a system that was itself creative, that spawned as much as it imitated. Random dice rolls were one of the prime sparks of inspiration. Granted, dice are as old as games themselves, but D&D didn’t just take them at face value or use them to move a pawn; it employed them, in very odd varieties, to create an entire probabilistic universe. D&D doesn’t tell you what an adventure is; it tells you what it might be.
#
#                           When I speak of inspiration, obviously the ones being inspired are other players. Gygax’s wacky tables inspired thousands of DMs for better, for worse, and most usually for both. I was certainly among them. I’ve even used D&D dice to determine real life; during my stint as an art critic, I used a d20 to choose exhibits to go see as a routine-breaker. But in-game, randomness and the exotic matrixed in my mind in the form of a giant imaginary library from which I could pluck randomly generated tomes, a fantasy born of inclination, early exposure to “The Name of the Rose,” and the hyperliteracy that plunged me nose-deep into D&D in the first place.
#
#                                       D&D inspired me to have such dreams, and skilled me in executing them. One of the privileges, or dangers, of DM-ing is being able to project, or inflict, one’s fantasies on other people; so I created a random book generator for a 14,000-volume library I installed in a castle in the first epic-length campaign I wrote. I’ve now played that segment of the game through with three different people (it is a single-player campaign), only one of whom actually plucked books from the library shelves, as I recall, and then only perhaps a half-dozen tomes. I, on the other hand, have probably spent eight or 10 hours enjoying the random book generator by myself, just me and my dice bag. It’s not the greatest thing I ever made; indeed, it’s a rather depersonalized, high/generic-adventure device in a fairly imitative game designed by someone still learning the ropes (or tentacles). But in substance and style, employment and enjoyment, I think it says as much about D&D as Gygax’s 1E originalities do, so I offer it here for edifying comparison—and, in the communal DIY punk-as-fuck spirit of D&D, for incorporation into your game, if your wrist be strong enough to roll it up:
